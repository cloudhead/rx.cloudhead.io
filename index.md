# *rx* is a modern and minimalist pixel editor.

*rx* is an *extensible*, modern and minimalist pixel editor, designed with great
care and love for artists and hackers. It was conceived to have
as little UI as possible, and instead focus on the *work*.

To achieve this, `rx` takes inspiration from [vi][0]'s modal nature and is
built around a *command system*, unique to tools of its kind.

*rx was created in 2019 by [cloudhead](https://cloudhead.io) and implemented
in the [rust][1] programming language, using the [rgx][2] library by
the same author.*

## get started

*rx* can be installed on Linux, macOS and Windows with:

    $ cargo install rx

See the [build][build] section for further details.

* To learn how to *use* rx, read the [guide][guide].
* To learn how rx *works*, browse the [source](https://github.com/cloudhead/rx).

## goals

* **Minimal.** Small, hackable codebase and dependency footprint. The editor
  should only include what is necessary.

* **Beautiful.** Clean, modern aesthetics with a strong attention to detail.

* **Snappy.** No perceptible input lag. Update and paint time should be
  less than `8ms` on commodity hardware at 1920x1080.

* **Configurable & extensible.** Artists should be in control of their workflow.
  If it isn't built-in, it should be easy to extend the editor's functionality.

* **Resource efficient.** Battery drain should be minimized. Memory footprint should
  be small.

## features

  * Built-in sprite animation support, with live preview.
  * Work with multiple files simultaneously.
  * Extensible command system.
  * Configurable with a simple text-based language.
  * HiDPI support.
  * UI scaling.
  * Undo/redo any edit.
  * Animated GIF output.
  * Multi-brush / synchronous editing.
  * Brush filtering a.k.a. "pixel-perfect" mode.
  * Visual mode for pixel manipulation.

## system requirements

`rx` currently supports Linux, macOS and Windows.

### linux

On Linux, [Vulkan][vulkan] support is required.

* On debian-based systems, the drivers can be installed via the
`mesa-vulkan-drivers` package. In addition, `vulkan-tools` may be required.
* On Arch Linux, `vulkan-icd-loader` is required in addition to the drivers. See
[here][arch] for more information.

[vulkan]: https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/

### macOS

On macOS, [Metal][metal] support is required. This usually requires installing Xcode
and the Xcode Command Line Tools.

[metal]: https://developer.apple.com/metal/

### windows

On Windows, *Vulkan* support is required.

## download

At the moment, only *Linux* binaries are available. You can download the
latest version here:

> [rx-0.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.AppImage][app]

This is an [AppImage][appimage], a self-contained application. Before opening
it, make it executable with `chmod +x`. You can then double-click it or execute
it directly from your terminal.

Feel free to rename it to `rx` and move it to your `PATH`. To uninstall,
simply delete the file.

[app]: https://github.com/cloudhead/rx/releases/download/v0.3.0/rx-0.3.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.AppImage
[appimage]: https://appimage.org/

For *macOS* and *Windows*, official builds are not yet available. See the
[build][build] section to build and install *rx* from source.

*If you'd like to help the project by offering macOS or Windows builds, please
contact the author at <rx@cloudhead.io>.*

## build & install from source

If you have [cargo][cargo] and [cmake][cmake] installed, simply run:

    $ cargo install rx

This will download the latest *stable* release of `rx` and install it under
`~/.cargo/bin/rx`.  If you prefer a different install location, you can specify
it via the `--root <prefix>` flag, where `<prefix>` is for example
`/usr/local`.

[cargo]: https://crates.io/install
[cmake]: https://cmake.org/download/

On **macOS**, **Xcode** and the **Xcode Command Line Tools** are required.  The
latter can be obtained by running `xcode-select --install`. CMake can be
installed with `brew install cmake`.

## usage

The [guide][guide] is the best place to learn how to use `rx`.

You can also use the `:help` command (shortcut <kbd>?</kbd>) to show the
active set of key mappings and commands inside of `rx`.
